Welcome to the Ranova technical interview! This test consists of Python and React challenges designed to assess your programming skills.

## Getting Started

### üöÄ Quick Start (Recommended)
Click the button below to launch the pre-configured environment:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/smitfire/ranova-interview-test)

Once Gitpod loads, you'll find:
- `challenges/python_challenge.py` - Python coding challenge
- `challenges/react_challenge.tsx` - React coding challenge

Both files will open automatically with instructions inside.

### üíª Local Setup (Alternative)
